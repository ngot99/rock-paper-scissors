Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously chooses one of three shapes. 

The possible shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors". The winner is determined based on the rules: rock crushes scissors (rock wins), scissors cuts paper (scissors win), and paper covers rock (paper wins). 

If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie, and it's typically played again. The game is often used as a decision-making tool or as a simple way to settle disputes or make quick choices. 

Player 1 will use keys "a", "s", and "d" to pick to select their object while Player 2 will use keys "j", "k", and "l".
